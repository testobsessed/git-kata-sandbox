This is a test file.
Next I will write a haiku.
And add yet more text.

Now I need a haiku editor.
Changed my email in .git/config
Had to change it again.

Could it be true that all that matters is the email?
And does that stay true when pushing w/ ssh v https?
So I can commit w a username that isn't even a collaborator?

WHEEE! YAKS!
